# Trivia Game

Write about this project.

## User Stories

These things are required.

- [ ] The user can select a category of questions to be quizzed on
- [ ] The faster a user answers, the higher they score for that question
- [ ] Dark mode/light mode toggle
- [ ] Confirm selection? Or save on the first click?

## Maybes

These things would be nice to have and might even make this trivia app stand out from others.

- [ ] Let the user change difficulty? If multiple users are contributing to the leaderboard, how would the different difficulty options affect that?
- [ ] Leaderboard by category?
- [ ] Keep track of current user's high score
